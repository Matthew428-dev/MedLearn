/* Utility helper classes
 *
 * This file is intentionally left mostly empty because the current
 * codebase does not make use of atomic utility classes. It can be
 * expanded with helpers such as margin, padding or text alignment
 * utilities if a future need arises. For example:
 *
 *   .u-mt-1 { margin-top: 0.25rem; }
 *   .u-text-center { text-align: center; }
 *
 * Keeping this file separate allows for quick additions without
 * polluting component or layout styles.
