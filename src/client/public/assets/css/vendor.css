/* Third‑party and vendor overrides
 *
 * This file is reserved for vendor CSS tweaks or overrides that are
 * separate from our core styles. The project currently includes
 * a dedicated phone‑override.css which modifies the default styling of
 * the intl‑tel‑input library. We import that file here without
 * modifying its contents so it gets bundled alongside our own styles.
 * If additional vendor customisations are needed in the future, they
 * can be added below.
